# dbt Data Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my dbt portfolio. This repository is a collection of end-to-end data engineering projects designed to demonstrate mastery of **dbt Core**, local analytical databases (**DuckDB**, **Postgres**), and production-grade workflow automation.

The goal of this repository is to showcase a progression from foundational data modeling to advanced analytics engineering.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

* **Transformation:** dbt Core
* **Databases:** DuckDB (OLAP), PostgreSQL
* **Quality & Governance:** SQLFluff (Linting), dbt-checkpoint (Pre-commit), dbt-utils
* **Infrastructure:** Docker, GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
* **Visualization:** Evidence.dev / Metabase (Local)


## 📈 Learning Objectives

My journey through these projects focuses on three core pillars of Analytics Engineering:

1. **Code Quality:** Writing modular, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) SQL using Macros and Packages.
2. **Reliability:** Implementing robust testing suites to ensure data integrity.
3. **Portability:** Using local-first tools (DuckDB/Docker) to build production-ready environments without cloud costs.
